This project is a fork from a GitHub repository, with modifications made to integrate an AI chatbot for personalized fitness assistance.

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Shape Up: Fitness Website Development

Shape Up is a comprehensive fitness website developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with an integrated AI chatbot. This project aims to provide users with a personalized fitness experience through intuitive UI/UX and intelligent chatbot interactions.

ü§ñ AI Chatbot Integration

As part of this group project, my primary responsibility was integrating an AI chatbot using the Botsonic custom AI chatbot API. Leveraging my skills in natural language processing and AI, I trained the chatbot model on fitness-related databases and knowledge bases. This enables the chatbot to provide tailored guidance on workouts, diet plans, athlete insights, and more.

Key Features:

User Profiles: Create personalized fitness profiles.
Workout Planner: Schedule and track workouts.
Nutrition Tracker: Monitor diet and nutrition intake.
AI Chatbot Assistance: Instant support and guidance powered by AI.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, Redux
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
AI Chatbot: Botsonic API
This repository contains the source code for the Shape Up project, including frontend components, backend services, AI chatbot integration, and deployment configurations.
